# ssb-integration-tests

integration tests that can check any two sbot implementations are compatible

all tests are driven via the command line interface and the implementations are
running as processes, so these tests should be usable even for other implementations.

## tests

### load

generate messages deterministically, load into sbot instance, read them back out
(must match input, including order added).
